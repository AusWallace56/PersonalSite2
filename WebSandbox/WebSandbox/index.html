                <h2>Front End Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Front end development is the tier of fullstack web development that deals with the visual elements
                    of an application that a user interacts with. The main three languages used in Front End Development
                    is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the lanuages that web browsers understand.
                    <br />  <!--This is a line break. It is a self-closing tag and does not require any attributes.-->
                    If you were to compare this tiers of development to a part of the human body, it would be like the skin.

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to define the stucture of the content of a webpage.
                        It is arguably the most important front end development language because the other languages
                        use HTML elements to perform their respective functions.

                    <p>
                        Cascading StyleSheets (CSS) is used for the formatting and layout of web page content. It was
                        introduced as a way to seperate the concern of markup (HTML) and formatting (CSS) into seperate files.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript (JS) allows us to make our webpages more interactive. Its primary use is that it provides
                        the ability to preform programming logic in the front end, react to events, and alidate form data.

                <h2>This is Lorem Ipsum (Sample Text)</h2>
                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is sample text that is often used when webistes are being designed before the actual
                    written copy has been created. Traditionally, it was written in Latin, but there are now many online
                    resources for generating themed Lorem Ipsum.
